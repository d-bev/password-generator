# password-generator

A simple and secure password generator for use in IT environments

Passwords are generated in the form of: [adjective]-[noun]-[integer between 10 and 99]

# TODO:
    - allow the user to determine the format themselves:
        - give a set of options for the seperation symbol, instead of just a hyphen
        - user can choose the range of randomly generated integers
        - user can rearrange the order the adjective, noun, and integer appear in (i.e. [noun]-[integer]-[adjective])
